# Entities

The datastore entities here are unrelated to the Event Store data.
Rather here you store SeaORM entities, usually generated by:

```bash
# Generate entity files of database ${DATABASE_URL} to `entities/src`
redo entities
```

**NOTE:** The following is not best-practice, and should be done when confident
that `redo entities` is not appropriate.

To manually update a specific table, say `customers`:

```bash
redo entities/src/customers
```
